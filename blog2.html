            <h2>The Dangers of Giving Systems of Artificial Intelligence Legal Personhood</h2>

            <p class = "block">
                <i>2.26.21</i>
            </p>

            <p class = "block">
            Imagine the following scenario: you are a female engineer applying for a position at Amazon. Being passionate about inclusion in STEM, you're part of an honors society for women in engineering, which you include on your resume. When you submit your job application, a resume scanner picks up this token, along with other potentially gender-identifying information, and feeds it to a machine-learning model that was trained to disproportionately correlate success with male applicants over applicants of other genders. You do not get the job.
            </p>
            <p class = "block">
            You later learn of the bias exhibited by Amazon’s AI and decide to sue for gender discrimination. However, the system of artificial intelligence, or SAI, is recognized as a legal person, and so you must sue the SAI – not Amazon. While you can receive damages if the SAI is found liable, it would be significantly less substantial than if Amazon was found to be at fault, as Amazon has considerably more assets than its SAI. And there is nothing to stop Amazon from creating a new model that is just as biased as the last one.
            </p>
            <p class = "block">
            Juridical persons – entities that can own property, enter into contracts, and otherwise legally behave as a natural person would – are not new <a class = link target = "_blank" href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person">(1)</a>. Corporations, governments, and even a river in New Zealand <a class = link target = "_blank" href ="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/16/new-zealand-river-granted-same-legal-rights-as-human-being">(2)</a> are considered juridical, and thus legal, persons. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence and its subsequently quick introduction in our day-to-day lives, there is much discussion about how the law should deal with SAIs. One school of thought argues that since SAIs share the autonomous decision-making capabilities of legal persons, it is natural to include them under this definition. Although an elegant solution under current law, this is a dangerous precedent to set because it incorrectly assumes that SAIs have independent motives and because it prioritizes the rights of programmers over those of SAI users. 
            </p>
            <p class = "block">
            Artificial intelligence refers to any system that mimics human-like abilities to make decisions, problem-solve, and learn <a class = link target = "_blank" href ="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/what-is-artificial-intelligence">(3)</a>. It is intuitive to draw similarities between this definition and that of other juridical persons: corporations and governments use the aforementioned qualities to act in their own interests. This alone, however, is not sufficient to argue in favor of granting SAIs legal personhood, as has previously been done <a class = link target = "_blank" href ="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0267364916301777">(4)</a>. The key difference between an SAI and a legal person is that, for the time being, an SAI operates according to the agenda of another entity, and all autonomous decisions are made towards this agenda. 
            </p>
            <p class = "block">
            Today, AI is used in tightly-parameterized scenarios for which the programmer defines a motive. Take AlphaZero, the board game-playing AI built using reinforcement learning <a class = link target = "_blank" href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero">(5)</a>. AlphaZero is exceptionally good at making decisions that enable it to win games of chess, shogi, and go, but only because it was trained with this goal in mind. AlphaZero is not going to suddenly decide to stop playing board games and pursue, say, a career as an artist. This is not to say that SAIs cannot be trained as artists (quite the opposite – AI is increasingly being applied in the arts <a class = link target = "_blank" href ="https://news.artnet.com/market/first-ever-artificial-intelligence-portrait-painting-sells-at-christies-1379902">(6)</a>), but that the intention of the programmer defines an SAI’s application. This assumption that an SAI will act based on the motive of its developers may not hold forever, but the concepts of singularity and superintelligence remain, for now, in the realm of sci-fi.
            </p>
            <p class = "block">
            Another common argument in favor of designating SAIs as legal persons is that having programmers be wholly liable for the behavior of the artificial intelligence they develop, which is often unpredictable, would place an undue burden on those programmers. In turn, this would de-incentivize the creation of SAIs and possibly push work to unofficial markets <a class = link target = "_blank" href ="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0267364916301777">(4)</a>. But software developers must always consider risks when developing new technologies. Automatic software, such as a new operating system or web framework, may also behave in ways unintended by their programmers. While there is a technical distinction between the unforeseen behavior of an automatic system versus that of an autonomous system (the former being a bug and the latter being an independent decision), the programmer can test both before product release and thus should hold liability. 
            </p>
            <p class = "block">
            Methods for testing the efficacy and equity of SAIs are developing as fast as the technology itself. Using part of the training data as a validation set is a common practice in the development of machine-learning models <a class = link target = "_blank" href ="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2020/01/03/how-do-you-test-ai-systems/?sh=43eae587afd5">(7)</a>. Programmers must also look at development stages where bias may have been introduced that could be reflected in downstream applications. Take the scenario from above: while the question of liability was a novel one, Amazon did face a situation in which a resume-filtering tool they created to screen applicants exhibited a preference towards white men in their twenties to thirties <a class = link target = "_blank" href ="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G">(8)</a>. Thankfully it was never put into practice, largely because Amazon realized that a model trained on resumes from its hiring practices would reflect the gender representation gap in tech and the potentially biased decisions of previous recruiters. There is no reason to excuse other AI developers from this practice: while spotting unintended output from SAIs is undoubtedly nuanced, somebody must carry that responsibility.
            </p>
            <p class = "block">
            While artificial intelligence is certainly an amazing innovation that is already being applied towards bettering society, its unforeseeable nature as an autonomous agent brings the users of SAIs a new set of dangers. For instance, natural language processing (NLP) tools, which are a subset of machine learning, are increasingly being applied towards the detection of hate speech online <a class = link target = "_blank" href ="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W17-1101/">(9)</a>. However, these detectors have recently been shown to exhibit racial bias because the crowd-sourced annotators creating their training data misinterpreted instances of African American English as toxic language <a class = link target = "_blank" href ="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1163/">(10)</a>. If a user of a social platform using such an SAI felt that their content was removed as a result of racial discrimination, and the SAI was seen as a legal person, the social platform can effectively use the SAI as a legal scapegoat to avoid responsibility and avoid using its own assets to resolve a case.
            </p>
            <p class = "block">
            Thus, for the sake of user protections, developer accountability, and incongruity with other juridical persons, SAIs should not be given legal personhood. This is not to say that applying current legislative standards towards such a quickly evolving field is sufficient, which includes the extension of legal personhood to SAIs. Artificial intelligence has the potential to reshape how we interact with technology – we must make sure that the relevant policy meets it halfway.
